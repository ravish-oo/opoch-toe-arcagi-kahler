now i want u to STRICTLY take care of these:
0. Cehck the underspecificity in this high level WO and specify as per following points. thr is nothing called over specificfity in engineering as long as it is not ambiguous or contradictory. 
1. anything that u r specifying must be STRUCTLY grounded in our math spec, patches and addendum
1. we stick to core CS primitives. not catalogs. not external families of those kinds of things
2. stick to fundamental core CS approaches/algos as much as possible. that implentation we are doing are actualy graduate lvel implementaions in terms of concepts. so we shud do that 
3. do not consider optimizations unless it is really blocking or say has huge complexity. arc agi cares only about solutions
4. ensure receipts are first class citizens and that debugging is algebric. 
5. direct in 1-2 lines what to verify/test on real arc agi tests for reviewr. NOT for implementer
